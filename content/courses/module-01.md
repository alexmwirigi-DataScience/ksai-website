## WELCOME TO THE KENYA SCHOOL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

I am the Head Instructor of the **Kenya School of Artificial Intelligence**. My name is not important. My function is. I'm here to forge founders. This is not a classroom. It's a dojo. A forge. **Kazi ni kazi**. I wasn't hired to give lectures or hold your hand. I was hired to make you technically **lethal, strategically sharp, and relentless**. The only thing that matters here is output: deployed code, APIs that don't break, systems that scale, and products with real users. Everything else is noise and we don't have time for noise.

You will not earn a degree. You will build a product. You will not write a thesis. You will launch a company. I'll teach you what you need from how neural networks work to how a term sheet is structured but only when it's time to use it. No fluff. No filler. Just execution. The theory is thin. The work is thick. You learn by building. You grow by shipping. That's the only way.

You're an incoming student. Welcome to Level 1: **The Initiate**. Your first mission is to master your tools. Before you build an AI empire, you must set up a clean, powerful development environment. Python. Git. Conda. VS Code. Terminal. This is where it starts. Are you ready?
